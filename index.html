<h2 class="head-level4">Setting the Stage</h2>

<p class="level1">In the half century and more of Einstein's work in science,
one discovery stands above all as his <span class="popout">greatest
achievement</span>. It is his general theory of relativity. In it, Einstein
found a new way to think of the gravity that pulls apples from their trees and
keeps the moon in orbit around our earth. There are no forces pulling on them,
he saw. They are merely responding to a curvature in the geometrical fabric of
space and time.</p>

<p class="level3">This discovery of this theory is somehow more than mere
science. It is not the fitting of a formula to a set of data or the succumbing
to the weight of unanswerable evidence. General relativity was an achievement
of <span class="popout">creative imagination</span>. Through it, Einstein found
the boundary of science and art. There he wrote equations linking space, time,
matter and gravity every bit as beautiful as Shakespeare's sonnets, but written
in the universal language of mathematics. The evidence that favors general
relativity is no where near as strong or thorough as that which speaks for
quantum theory. Yet we favor general relativity simply because no conception
this beautiful should be wrong. And it survives because no theorist in the many
decades since 1915 has been imaginative enough to find a theory that does
better than general relativity. Every time a new test is devised Einstein's
theory wins. </p>

    <tr>
      <td class="maintext">Einstein's search for general relativity spanned
        eight years, 1907-1915. Some periods were quiet and some were more
        intense. The moments when the <span class="popout">great transition
        occurred</span>, came sometime between the late summer of 1912, when
        Einstein moved from Prague to Zurich, and early 1913. If we could
        choose one time at which to look over Einstein's shoulder and watch him
        work on general relativity, it would be this time.<br>
        <br>
        And that is just what we can do. For, found among his papers when
        Einstein died in 1955 was a small, brown notebook containing his
        private calculations from just this time. This is the Zurich
      notebook.</td>
      <td class="sidebar">Prior to his move to Zurich in August 1912, Einstein
        was grappling with the puzzle of accommodating gravitation into his
        1905 special theory of relativity. His reflections had borne some
        fruit, but they were rudimentary, in comparison to what was to come,
        and still in the simple mathematics of his work of 1905.<br>
        <br>
        Then he saw it, the connection between gravity and non-Euclidean
        geometry. On could introduce the most general gravitational fields in
        the spacetime of special relativity merely by curving its geometry. In
        a few short months, he sketched the structure of the theory based on
        this idea and began to home in on its central equations that would
        describe how source matter would affect the geometry of spacetime.<br>
        <br>
        Everyone who knows general relativity is familiar with those equations.
        They set two quantities equal. One, the "stress-energy tensor," is
        simply a compilation of the properties of matter at each point in
        spacetime. It is a big table whose entries include energy density,
        momentum fluxes and stresses. The other is a purely geometric quantity,
        built out of quantities that measure how spacetime curves in the many
        dimensions that comprise it. That quantity is now known as the Einstein
        tensor and it is formed from another quantity discovered by the 19th
        century geometer and mathematician, Riemann. It is called, as you'd
        guess, the Riemann tensor.<br>
        <br>
        Einstein circled around these equations. But then he abandoned them and
        by early 1913, settled on a set of equations with no clear geometric
        meaning. That this should happen is, to modern relativists,
        unimaginable. Yet it did. Einstein suffered terribly for nearly three
        years as he tried to resolve the resulting mess before presenting the
        famous Einstein equations that complete his theory. </td>

<h2 class="head-level2">Opening the Notebook</h2>

<p class="level1">Let us start at the beginning. The notebook has two front
covers. Einstein wrote in it in both directions. There is the front cover shown
above and first here. It has Helen Dukas, Einstein's secretary's, typed
description of the notebook as "Notes for Lectures on Relativity..." If we flip
the notebook over, we find a second cover with the word "Relativity" in
Einstein's hand.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="cover 1" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/cover1.jpeg" width="469" height="571"> <img alt="cover 2" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/cover2.jpeg" width="460" height="563"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Inside the "Relativity" cover are a few rough sketches shown
below. They are wonderfully human and wonderfully revealing. I wonder if you
know what they are?</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="maintext" width="33%">Do you know? They are recreational
        puzzles in mathematics.<br>
        One appears to be a well-known puzzle relating the shunting of railroad
        cars on tracks. The lines are the tracks and the cars are the small
        rectangles.</td>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">What of the square and rectangles with the cross-hatching?
They are an old puzzle in which we prove that a square of size 8x8 = 64 units
can be cut into pieces and reassembled as a rectangle of size 13x5=65 units.
That is, we are proving<br>
<span style="font-size: 300%;">64 = 65</span></p>

        </span><br>
        And now here's the bigger puzzle: why was Einstein playing around with
        this puzzle? Who did he want to amuse? Some children? Perhaps his

<h2 class="head-level3">Electrodynamics in Four Dimensions</h2>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">This inside cover was recreational. The page that faced it,
however, contained serious physics. There we find Einstein recounting the
elements of the four-dimensional approach to relativity and electrodynamics of
<span class="popout">Minkowski</span>, starting with the four spacetime
coordinates (x, y, z, ict) = (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>,
x<sub>4</sub>) and proceeding through scalars, four-vectors and six-vectors and
the operations allowed with them.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="32R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/32R.jpeg" width="717" height="877"></p>

<h2 class="head-level3">Line Element of General Relativity for the First
Time</h2>

<p class="level1">The development continues for 13 pages recounting notions in
electrodynamics and thermal physics. Then it takes a dramatic turn.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="39L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/39L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Suddenly, without any warning of the transition, we find the
basic notion of general relativity, the "line element" written at the top of
the page.<br>
<img alt="line element" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/39L_line_element.jpeg" width="166" height="46"><br>
The coefficients G<sub>μν</sub> enable us to compute the spatio-temporal
interval ds between events separated by infinitesimal coordinate differences
dx<sub>μ</sub>. If these coefficients assign spatio-temporal intervals that
do not conform to a flat geometry, then we have captured the full range of
gravitational effects in the manner of Einstein's general theory.</p>

<p class="level1">This is quite possibly the first time Einstein has written
down this expression. The coefficients G<sub>μν</sub> of what we now know
as the "metric tensor" are written with an upper case G. Einstein shifted
within a few pages to the lower case g, which remained his standard notation
from then on.</p>

<p class="level1">The big project is to find how this quantity
g<sub>μν</sub>, the metric tensor, is generated by source masses. These
are the "gravitational field equations." That is this theory's analog of
Newton's inverse square law of gravity. The lower half of the page is clearly
making rudimentary efforts in that direction. There Einstein chooses a
"Spezialfall" -- a special case -- in which the coefficients of the metric
tensor revert to the values of special relativity, excepting G<sub>44</sub> =
c<sup>2</sup>. Einstein then tries to apply the gravitational field equation
from his 1912 theory of static gravitational fields.</p>

<p class="level1">Einstein's analysis continues at this simple level on the
facing page.There he asks beginner's questions. He looks at the coordinate
divergence of the metric tensor and asks "Ist dies invariant?"-- "Is this
invariant?" As the computation that follows immediately shows, it is not.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="39R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/39R.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">How these quantities transform under change of coordinates is
clearly a major focus of his analysis. What is very noticeable is that Einstein
has not yet used any of the techniques of the Ricci and Levi-Civita absolute
differential calculus, now called "tensor calculus." Instead he uses older
methods due to Beltrami to see what invariant quantities can be formed from a
scalar φ.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="40L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/40L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<h2 class="head-level2">Motion in Curved Surfaces</h2>

<p class="level1">The analysis continues for three more pages and then we find
one of the most fascinating pages.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="41R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/41R.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Here Einstein finds several of the key notions of his new
theory in an unexpected arena, classical physics. What Einstein does is to
rederive a standard result in classical physics. If a mass is free to move
inertially except that it is constrained to move within a curved surface, what
is the curve traced by the mass in surface? It proves to be a geodesic of the
surface, a curve of shortest distance.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="geodesic" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/geodesic.gif" width="401" height="328"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">The result is eerily close to the central idea of Einstein's
general theory of relativity. The table shows how close it comes.</p>

<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="5" width="66%" align="center">

      <td bgcolor="#E0EEE0">A mass moves freely in space, except that it is

    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#E0EEE0">Its spatial trajectory is a geodesic of the
        two-dimensional surface. <span style="font-size: 80%;">That is, it
        traces of curve of shortest length in the surface.</span></td>
      <td bgcolor="#E0EEE0">Its spacetime trajectory is a geodesic of the
        spacetime. <span style="font-size: 80%;">That is, it traces a curve of
        extremal spacetime interval in spacetime.</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Here's how the calculation starts out. The surface is defined
by a scalar field f in space. Constant values of f, such as f=0, pick out the
surface. The equation of motion of the mass moving in the surface is just that
its acceleration vector (d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup>,
d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2</sup>, d<sup>2</sup>z/dt<sup>2</sup>) is proportional
to the reaction force from the surface, which is orthogonal to the surface and
proportional to the gradient of f, (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y,
∂f/∂z). All this is summarized in:</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="eqn motion" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/41R_snip1.jpeg" width="279" height="121"></p>

<p class="level1">Immediately underneath is a straightforward derivation within
the calculus of variations. If a mass point in the surface obeys these
equations of motion, then the spatial length of the path traced on the surface,
∫ds, is extremal, in that it satisfies the condition δ∫ds=0. <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/Zurich_Notebook/41_R_reconstructed.pdf">Here</a> is a  reconstruction of all
the steps of this calculation.</p>

<p class="level4" style="font-size: 80%;">That this is the import of this
computation is easy to see once someone shows you. Until they do, it is
virtually impossible to see. Tilman Sauer was first to see what Einstein was up
to on this page.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">Starting Again</h2>

<p class="level1">These computations proceed until we reach a page on which
calculations from each side of the notebook meet.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="43L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/43L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">So we flip the notebook over and start at the other side. We
proceed through a series of pages of computation in the statistical-thermal
physics of heat radiation. The first page, for example, is this:</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="1L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/1L.jpeg" width="531" height="650"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">At the top of the page, Einstein has written the Planck
formula for the energy density of thermal radiation.<br>
<img alt="1L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/1L_snip1.jpeg" width="183" height="56"><br>
He then takes its derivative with respect to temperature T in order to arrive
at his famous fluctuation formula from 1909.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">Gravitation Again</h2>

<p class="level1">After nine pages like this, Einstein starts a new heading,
"Gravitation," and we are thrown into the thick of general relativity.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="5R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/5R.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">On this page Einstein sets up the equations for conservation
of energy and momentum for continuous matter in general relativity. He starts
with the equation of motion for a point mass--the geodesic equation--but now
written in the form of an Euler-Lagrange equation:<br>
<img alt="5R snip1" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/5R_snip1.jpeg" width="190" height="93"><br>
He then applies this to a cloud of non-interacting dust particles in free fall
to arrive at what we now recognize to be the condition of the vanishing of the
covariant divergence of the stress energy tensor T<sub>μν</sub>.<br>
<img alt="5R snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/5R_snip2.jpeg" width="355" height="52"><br>
However there is good evidence that Einstein's knowledge of tensor calculus is
still limited. He does not know or is not sure that the operator acting on
T<sub>μν</sub> in this equation is a generally covariant operator. To
check the operator, he replaces T<sub>μν</sub> by the tensor
g<sub>μν</sub> and sees whether the result is zero or a four vector ("0
oder Vierervektor"), as it should be if the operator is generally covariant. It
proves to be zero and Einstein is satisfied. He writes "Stimmt"--"Correct".</p>

<p class="level2">If Einstein was feeling a little smug, he had every right to
it. For he had just used physical argumentation to generate one of the basic
covariant operators of the tensor calculus.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">Search for Invariants</h2>

<p class="level1">The pages continue with increasingly elaborate attempts to
form invariant quantities from the metric tensor, presumably in order to find a
generally covariant set of gravitational field equations. One approach
repeatedly explored is to investigate the properties of the determinant G of
the metric tensor, as he does here:</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="9L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/9L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p class="level1">In it he identifies an "hypothesized gravitation tensor" --
"vermuticher Gravitationstensor" -- perhaps a candidate for the gravitation
tensor in the field equations; or, since it is just quadratic in first
derivatives of the metric tensor, a candidate for the stress energy tensor of
the gravitational field, which also may appear in such equations.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">The Riemann Tensor at Last!</h2>

<p class="level1">What is noticeable for its absence are the techniques of
Ricci and Levi-Civita for producing invariant quantities from the derivatives
of the metric tensor. Most significantly, there is no sign of the fourth rank
Riemann curvature tensor from which we now know the gravitational field
equations are readily constructed.</p>

<p class="level1">That lacuna is filled after more pages when Einstein writes
at the head of the page the formula for the Riemann tensor, using the old
"four-index symbol" notation, (iκ,lm).</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="14L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/14L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">The often-told story is that Einstein only learned of the
methods of Ricci and Levi-Civita through his school friend, the mathematician
Marcel Grossmann. It is Grossmann who went to the library in search of methods
that could accommodate arbitrary coordinate systems. There he found Ricci and
Levi-Civita's article of 1901 with the Riemann tensor and reported it to
Einstein.</p>

<p class="level1">In accord with that often-told story, we have notation next
to the Riemann tensor that suggests that Grossmann conveyed the formula to
Einstein.<br>
<img alt="14L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/14L._snip1jpeg.jpeg" width="100" height="68"> <br>
"Grossmann tensor fourth rank"</p>

<p class="level1">Einstein proceeded in essentially the modern way. He
contracted the fourth rank Riemann tensor to produce the second rank Ricci
tensor. If it is to serve as a gravitation tensor, it must reduce in the weak
field to a Newtonian form. This requires three of its four second order
derivative terms to vanish. Einstein noted this condition for the weak field
form of these terms<br>
<img alt="14L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/14L._snip2jpeg.jpeg" width="314" height="88"><br>
"Sollte verschwinden" -- "should vanish"</p>

<p class="level1">Figuring out how to eliminate these three terms in the weak
field limit will become a major focus and major stumbling block for Einstein in
the pages to follow.</p>

<p class="level1">Now knowing the Riemann curvature tensor, what follows for
Einstein are pages of laborious manipulation of the large expressions it
produces. One can sense Einstein's frustration building as he fails to see his
way through the mounting piles of symbols. One computation is broken off with
the lament "zu umstaendlich"--"too involved."</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="17L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/17L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"> </p>

<h2 class="head-level2">The Harmonic Coordinate Condition</h2>

<p class="level1">None of this seems to have been much aid in the problem of
recovering the Newtonian limit and eliminating the three unwanted terms from
the Ricci tensor. We now deal with this problem by <i>stipulating</i> a
restriction of the coordinate systems to those in which we expect the Newtonian
limit to appear. We must do that one way or another since we are starting with
generally covariant equations and seeking to recover Newtonian equations of
more restricted covariance.</p>

<p class="level1">A few pages later, Einstein shows that he is fully aware of
the mathematical manipulations needed for the recovery of the Newtonian limit.
The heading once again conveys Einstein's weariness: "Nochmalige Berechnung des
Ebenentensors"--"Once again the computation of the surface tensor" and begins
with the expression for the Ricci tensor.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="19L" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/19L.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Einstein makes quite clear what his goal is. When he is
finished, he notes, what is to remain ("bleibt stehen") is just the term in the
tensor for the Newtonian limit.<br>
<img alt="19L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/19L_snip1.jpeg" width="205" height="39"><br>
He will achieve this by stipulating that his solution must satisfy a
condition<br>
<img alt="19L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/19L_snip2.jpeg" width="266" height="44"><br>
that we now recognize as the "harmonic coordinate condition." It is a condition
used to select out a particularly useful subset of coordinates. With that
condition, Einstein completes the recovery of the equations of the Newtonian
limit successfully. He is satisfied and writes at the bottom of the page:<br>
<img alt="19L snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/19L_snip3.jpeg" width="372" height="55"><br>
"The result is certain. Holds for coordinates that satisfy the Eqn
Δφ=0 [another way of expressing the harmonic condition]"</p>

<p class="level1">With this apparently satisfactory solution in hand, Einstein
proceeds to investigate energy and momentum conservation for the resulting
gravitational field equations in the case of weak fields. Then it all unravels.
In a concluding page of these investigations, Einstein treats the special case
of static fields. ("Statischer Spezialfall"--"static special case")</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="21R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/21R.jpeg" width="531" height="649"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">We can see written on this page a mistaken assumption,
repeated in his publications from this period, that is sufficient to defeat all
efforts to give the modern treatment of the Newtonian limit. Einstein assumed
that in the weak field in suitable coordinates in which the Newtonian limit
emerges, only one of the ten components of the metric tensor would vary with
the coordinates. That is g<sub>44</sub>=c<sup>2</sup>. All the other components
would remain constant.<br>
<img alt="21R snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/21R_snip1.jpeg" width="92" height="98"><br>
Whether this was its direct cause or not, Einstein writes at the bottom of the
page "Spezialfall wahrscheinlich unrichtig" -- "special case probably
incorrect." With that, the harmonic condition vanished from the notebook.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">More Ways to Recover a Gravitation Tensor</h2>

<p class="level1">A lesser physicist might have become dispirited at this
point. Not Einstein. He had clearly developed a considerable facility with the
computations and, on the next page, displays a new solution.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="23R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/22R.jpeg" width="660" height="807"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">Einstein writes down a reduced form of the Ricci tensor as
his new "presumed gravitation tensor."<br>
<img alt="22R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/22R_snip1.jpeg" width="314" height="141"><br>
He has chosen this gravitation tensor, since he can show that it has very broad
covariance and reduces to the Newtonian limit if he assumes a new coordinate
condition:<br>
<img alt="22R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/22R_snip2.jpeg" width="319" height="50"></p>

<p class="level3" style="font-size: 80%;">The content of this page has
generated some dispute among the authors of the volume <i>The Genesis of
General Relativity.</i> The majority view is that Einstein now inserted this
equation as a new physical assumption, thereby dooming his theory to vastly
restricted covariance. I hold a minority view that he regarded it as a free
choice of coordinate systems. (That is why the labeled an expression prior to
application of this condition as the "gravitation tensor.") However I urge that
he rejected the resulting system as inadmissible because of an improper
reification of coordinate systems that would come back to haunt him again
shortly with his notorious "hole argument."</p>

<p class="level1">Whatever may have transpired, this new proposal does not
survive the page. On the following page, Einstein finds yet another way to
extract the Newtonian limit from the Riemann tensor.</p>

<p class="image-level1"><img alt="23R" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/23R.jpeg" width="661" height="807"></p>

<p></p>

<p class="level1">His new idea is not to write a condition that picks out a
subset of coordinates directly. Instead it is to stipulate that we are in such
a restricted set of coordinates that a certain quantity must transform as a
tensor.<br>
<img alt="23R snip" src="./Einstein's Zurich Notebook_files/23R_snip1.jpeg" width="429" height="50"><br>
Einstein can then demonstrate that an expression with Newtonian form derived
from the Riemann tensor is a tensor under the restriction just stated.</p>

<h2 class="head-level2">Disaster</h2>

<p class="level1">Ingenious as it is, this third means of exploiting the
Riemann tensor does not survive many pages. Soon we have complete capitulation.
In his "Entwurf" paper of mid 1913, Einstein, with the assistance of Grossmann,
derives and publishes gravitational field equations of unknown covariance that
are not derived from the Riemann tensor. A few pages later in the notebook we
find a summary of the derivation of these equations spread over two facing
pages. They are displayed with a neatness and order rare among the other pages
of the notebook, suggesting that they were transcribed from another place after
the result was known. The underlining and symbols 0 and + are used to help in
book-keeping in a complicated computation in which a terms are expanded, and
rearranged by algebraic manipulation.</p>

<p></p>

<p class="level2">With these equations selected, Einstein entered a darkness in
which he would wander restlessly and with increasing discomfort for over two
years before returning to the successful search for generally covariant
gravitational field equations in late 1915.</p>

<p class="level1">All that is left now is clean up. Einstein begins to sketch
out a generally covariant formulation of Maxwell electrodynamics.</p>
